We're going to explore several bootstrap components, like cards, dropdowns, buttons, and navigation barsand to build a responsive travel website.

We'll start by customizing several card componenets and placing them inside a grid. Then you'll take some time to explore and use several other componeents to build and design your travel page. 

Once you've added a few additional components to your page, then you get ready to style learn how to use boostrap's documentation to style your page.
